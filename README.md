# Evil Scientist Registry

### Overview

This web application allows users to add new evil scientists, view a list of all evil scientists, and view the details of a specific evil scientist.

### Features

### Technology Stack

- **TypeScript:** Handles user interactions and data manipulation with strong typing and advanced features.
- **[Insert your framework/library here, e.g., React, Vue, Angular]**

### Data Structure

Data about the evil scientists is stored in a JavaScript array. Each element in the array is an object representing an evil scientist. The object contains the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the evil scientist.
- `age`: The age of the evil scientist.
- `henchmen`: The number of henchmen.
- `description`: A brief description.

### How it works

1. **Form:** When the user fills out the form and clicks "Add", a new object representing the evil scientist is created and added to the array of evil scientists.
2. **List:** The list is updated to display the names of all evil scientists in the array.
3. **Details:** When a user clicks a name in the list, the details section is updated to display the information of the selected evil scientist.
